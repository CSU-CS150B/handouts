# This is an inclass activity.

# For programming every line of code that isn't a comment
# Gets executed one at a time
# Eventually, you will learn how to block
# these lines into resuable code snippets (called functions)
# but for now, we will just run every line, one at a time. 

# STEP 1: create variables, one for each person at the table
# Store their names in the variables
# example:
person0 = "Samus Aran"


# Step 2: Write a variables that store everyones
# favorite number
fav0 = 22


# Step 3: write a print statements that outputs
# "name's favorite number is number"
# you may need to use the str(value) function!, example str(fav0)

print()
print()
print("..Interactive Program Start..")
# Step 4: Get an input from a client asking their name

# Step 5: Get an input from a client asking their favorite number

# Step 6: print out name's favorite number is number
