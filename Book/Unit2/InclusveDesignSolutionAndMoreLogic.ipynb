    "* Meets Compliance\n",
    "* Often requires special tools or accommodations\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of accessible, but not universal or inclusive?\n",
    "* To access your content, you have a special application designed for different ability levels.\n",
    "    * A gray scale version of the site, accessible by a special url.\n",
    "* A more obvious real world example?\n",
    "    * The accessible access entrance to the building is in the alley / back entrance\n",
    "        * Even with a sign pointing towards it, it meets compliance standards but not every welcoming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Design\n",
    "Designing in such a way, that accessibility is already built into the design.\n",
    "* Makes compliance default / built into design\n",
    "* Website example:\n",
    "    * Uses color pallet that is accessible for all ranges of colorblindness\n",
    "    * Looks good for all people\n",
    "* BBC Guidelines [Reference](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-accessibility)\n",

    "    * prioritize familiarity and consistency\n",

The holes in the original design were added for detail, but they ended up appearing as a cluster. To address the problem, the new icon reduces the holes while accentuating the design concept. ~ Naoki Yoshida\n",
